After the death of [FastText](http://www.caseyliss.com/2014/12/13/fast-text-discontinued), 
I needed replacement app for sending a message to my wife without too much effort.
And then, with the advent of extensions, I thought it might be useful to be able to
send photos, links and other biz to her as well.

Thus was born _Melissa_, a shortcut app for messaging my wife (and named after her,
for obvious reasons) without having to find or type her details in each time I want
to send her something. In an effort to make the app more generally useful, the name
was changed to _Other_.

## Requirements

This app uses [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org) for managing external dependencies.
To build the app you'll first need to run `pod install` from Terminal to download the
required dependencies and prepare them for building the project.

The app itself is written in Swift 2.3, and at this point, requires Xcode 8.
