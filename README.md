After the death of [FastText](http://www.caseyliss.com/2014/12/13/fast-text-discontinued), 
I needed replacement app for sending a message to my wife without too much effort.
And then, with the advent of extensions, I thought it might be useful to be able to
send photos, links and other biz to her as well.

Thus was born Melissa, a shortcut app for messaging my wife (and named after her,
for obvious reasons) without having to find or type her details in each time I want
to send her something.

##Requirements

This app uses [StaticTables](https://github.com/jellybeansoup/ios-statictables), an
open source library I wrote to easily manipulate table views. It's linked as a
submodule, which needs to be pulled before the app will build.

The app itself is written in Swift 2.0, and at this point, requires Xcode 7 beta 4.
